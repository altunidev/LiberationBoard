# LiberationBoard

DISCLAIMER:
This project has no political implications or affiliations, and is not linked to any one party _in any way_. The name of the board is derived from the fact that I'm building a keyboard specifically for Helldivers 2, which is a fictional game.

With that out the way, let's dig in!

## Structure

- QMK Keyboard
- Gamepad
- combined

Yeah that's basically the idea.
